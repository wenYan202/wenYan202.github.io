<p>🙋I am a Chinese girl. I finished my bachelor's degree at the University  Zhengzhou in China. My major was computer science and technology. Then I come to Germany to start my master and mainly focus on embedded system. In 2019, I graduated from Unnversity Duisburg-Essen. 👩‍🎓</p>
<p>❤️I love my major, comperter science and engeering.❤️</p>
<p>My time as a bachelor student opened my eyes to the excitement and wider benefit of computer science.  And then I had the chance to do some different projects on my Masters stage and that's inspired me to take up the challenge of future.</p>
<p>I condersider programming as the process of turning a brilliant idea into a reality, which can bring you strong feelings of achievment and satisfactory. Engineering is the bridge that takes people from standard life to e-life, which makes the whole world fantastic.</p>
<p>I love my life,  and full of enthusiasm, love cooking, love sporting, love travelling and  exploring.  Look forward to life and future.I hope I can always have a positive heart to meet every beautiful moment and  challenge.🎆</p>
